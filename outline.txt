Course goal:
* By the end of this course students will be able to propose a machine learning project that they can complete in 2 days with instructors' help.

Course assessment:
* Propose a machine learning project that you can complete in 2 days with instructors' help.

Instructional material in order of appearance.
Monday
* Play with some parameter sliders in Jupyter notebooks. Minimize loss on some convex thing like $e^X$ using sliders.
* Pass around ideas about how to automate this. Introduce the gist of SGD using some intuition like "walking downhill".
* Optionally review matrix addition, multiplication, derivatives in a notebook.
* SGD optimization of a linear classifier.
* Introduce multiple layers and nonlinearities in the context of modeling XOR. 2 layer networks, ReLU non-
* To conclude the day's lessons, summarize common tasks where artificial neural networks are employed (video-games, tesla, voice recognition, reinforcement learning)
Tuesday
* MNIST (MNIST dataset + handwrited* (probably)) solved, CIFAR by themselves (provide only DataLoader)
* Give them a working CNN, with momentum, and explain with a rolling ball analogy. Let them try MNIST, CIFAR10.
* Learn about validation and overfitting (trick with validation losses),
* Approx. End of Tuesday: Competition. Handwriting
